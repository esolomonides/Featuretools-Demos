"# featuretoolsdemo" 

The first method (with a helper function), plotstuff(dataset), is a computationally-inexpensive way to visualiza the data, and although it has not been fully polished I believe it handles the different quantitative and qualitative data types in an intuitive way. This would allow clients to get a good sense of what the feature matrix is telling them, making the actual data science part more palatable.

The second method, plotting2d(set), is a very rudimentary way to visualize the first-order relationships among the variables in the data. It just plots everything in 2D histograms, although it is only able to handle quantitative data types.
